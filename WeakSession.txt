Weak Session in DVWA 


To assess the robustness of DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) against weak session management vulnerabilities

Scenario:
    Weak session management vulnerabilities occur when session IDs are poorly implemented, allowing attackers to hijack or manipulate sessions to impersonate users.

Low Leve         - Session IDs are short, predictable, and based on non-random data .
Medium Level     -  Session IDs are slightly more complex but still lack sufficient randomness and entropy.
Hard Level       -  Session IDs are generated using pseudo-random values, providing moderate resistance to brute-force attacks.
Impossible Level - Session IDs are cryptographically secure and regenerated upon login or privilege changes.

Recommended :
    1. Implement Cryptographically Secure Session IDs
    2. Use SameSite Cookies .
    3. Secure Transmission
