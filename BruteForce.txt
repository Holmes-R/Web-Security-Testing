Brute Force Vulnerability Exploitation in DVWA 

This report documents the findings from a security test performed on the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) using the Burp Suite tool to simulate a brute force attack.

Scenario :
    A brute force attack was performed to exploit the login page of DVWA. 
    This attack involved automating multiple login attempts by submitting combinations of usernames and passwords until the correct credentials were identified.

Low Level        - No countermeasures .Predictable server response for successful login attempts
Medium Level     - Slight delay if password or username is incorrect .Error messages for invalid credentials .
High Level       - Strong rate-limiting ,account lockout after number of attempts .Error messages were standardized
Impossible Level - User token is hidden .Token based authentication .

Recommended :
    1. Implement Strong Lockout.
    2. Introduce CAPTCHA.
    3. Enforce Rate-Limit.
    4. Multi-Factor Authentication.
    5. Token-Based Authentication.
