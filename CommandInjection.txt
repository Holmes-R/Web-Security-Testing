Command Injection in DVWA

This report documents the findings from a security test performed on the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) to assess vulnerabilities related to command injection.

Scenario : 
    A Command Injection attack was performed to exploit the application's functionality, allowing attackers to execute unauthorized commands on the host operating system.
     The attack manipulated inputs to bypass restrictions and achieve Remote Command Execution (RCE). The test results were analyzed based on DVWA's predefined security levels.

Low Level        - The application allows direct input into PHP functions that execute commands on the OS.It is possible to escape the intended command logic and append arbitrary commands for execution.
Medium Level     - Pattern matching is implemented to filter some command inputs.However, incomplete filtering allows alternative system syntaxes to bypass the restrictions.
Hard Level       - Enhanced input filtering is applied, matching a broader range of patterns.Developer attempts to use specific PHP functions for sanitization but includes slight errors or typos, leaving room for bypass.
Impossible Level - Input validation is restructured to allow only specific, whitelisted values.

Recommended : 
    1. Sanitization of input .
    2. Restrict Command Execution .
    3. MFA .
    4. Enforce Least Privilege Principle .
