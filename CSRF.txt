CSRF Vulnerability in DVWA

To evaluate the robustness of DVWA against CSRF attacks by analyzing vulnerabilities across its predefined security levels

Scenario :
    A CSRF attack attempts to trick a user into executing unauthorized actions on a web application in which they are authenticated. 
    The test exploited scenarios where attackers could craft malicious links or forms, leveraging the victimâ€™s session to execute unintended actions.

Low Leve         -  Attackers can craft malicious links or forms to perform sensitive actions, such as changing a user's password, without their consent.
Medium Level     -  A basic referer check is implemented to validate the origin of requests.
Hard Level       -  The application introduces an anti-CSRF token mechanism.
Impossible Level - The application enforces strict validation by requiring the user's current password along with the new password.Without access to the user's credentials, attackers cannot perform unauthorized actions.

Recommended :
    1. CSRF Token .
    2. SameSite Cookies .
    3. Referer-Header
